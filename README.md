# Grafika_3Dszoba_raytracing
Program utilizing CPU ray tracing written in C++.

## Usage 
#### Clone the repo, go into Grafika-3Droom/bin, then run Skeleton.exe
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tkornel02/Grafika-3Droom.git
cd Grafika-3Droom/bin
Skeleton.exe
```
The program UI is a 3D room with different 3D objects. I am using ambient light to light all of them. 

There is three moveable cones, which emit light using raytracing.

The program responds to clicks, which moves the nearest cones peak to the clicked point.
